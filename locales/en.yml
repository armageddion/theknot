    Leave the city via the bridge nearest to the fortress. Follow the road for
    quite a while. Avoid the trap in Petrovaradin of turning right-ish towards
    Ruma/Beočin. Go more straight... When you see a Russian church on the left,
    turn right. Keep right at a big cross. When you see signs for “Velika
    Remeta” follow them.. When you can no longer see these signs, look for
    signs for “Uvac”. When you get to “Uvac”, take a gulp or a sip and a
    breath.. From here, follow the noise..

    ....or just use navigation...

    If you are capable of physical effort, congratulations! You are on build
    crew. You are expected at 1400h.

    If you don’t do manual labor or just want free booze and food, be there at
    1600h.

    To find out when you have to leave, enter you age into the above equation
    and do some maths.

    Note: we’ll be about half an hour from the city... if you get drunk, get
    someone else to take you home.

    This wedding is in a forest, under the open skies. Be prepared for all the

    - skis
    - high heels
    - personal vehicle
    - two romantic partners
    - food
    - drink
    - diving equipment

    We intend to remember this day for the rest of time, or at least, our
    lives. If you insist on gifting something that might help us remember this
    day for a long time to come, do feel encouraged. If, however, you feel like
    bribing us to turn the other cheek to the fact that you haven’t brought a
    thoughtful gift, you can use the helpful
    Venmo link to make your contribution; or, if you are a dinosaur, we will
    accept that archaic ritual of gifting a paper envelope.
