    We have decided to celebrate our love for each other with you - a small group
    of closest family members and dear friends. Grace us with your presence if you dare
    and make our celebration a little bit better than it would've been without yous.

    Our venue is limited capacity so leave your aligator, friend of friend and whatshisname...

  title: Ok, but where?

    Leave the city via the bridge nearest to the fortress. Follow the road for
    quite a while. Avoid the trap in Petrovaradin of turning right-ish towards
    Ruma/Beočin. Go more straight... When you see a Russian church on the left,
    turn right. Keep right at a big cross. When you see signs for “Velika
    Remeta” follow them.. When you can no longer see these signs, look for
    signs for "Ubavac”. When you get to "Ubavac”, take a gulp or a sip and a
    breath.. From here, follow the beautiful people..

    ....or just use navigation...

    To find out when you have to leave, enter you age into the above equation
    and do some maths.

    Note: we’ll be about half an hour from the city... if you get drunk, get
    someone else to take you home.

    things you may expect from a typical forest. There may be mud or even rain.
    It might get dark after sun goes down...

  list: |

    We intend to remember this day for the rest of time, or at least, our
    lives. If you insist on gifting something that might help us remember this
    day for a long time to come, do feel encouraged. If, however, you feel like
    bribing us to turn the other cheek to the fact that you haven’t brought a
    thoughtful gift, you can use the helpful [Venmo]() & [Paypal]() links to
    make your contribution; or, if you are a dinosaur, we will accept that
    archaic ritual of gifting a paper envelope.
